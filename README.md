PHP custom framework with an application example.
3 simple steps to run the application:
<br>
- Clone the repo
```
    git clone https://github.com/akwuh/phpaku.git
```
- Import Database dump `test.sql` from the folder `sql\`
<br>
- Change settings in `config\config.yml` (based on your mysql connection credentials):
```
db_host: localhost
db_name: test
db_user: root
db_password: 
```

That's it!
